# AI PDF Renamer

**AI PDF Renamer** is a simple but powerful tool that automatically renames PDF files based on their content using AI. By leveraging the capabilities of Ollama's AI models, the tool reads the text from PDFs and intelligently suggests a more descriptive and context-aware filename. This helps users keep their file libraries organized without the need to open each file and rename it manually.

### üîç Why Use It?

Manually renaming downloaded or scanned PDFs ‚Äî like research papers, invoices, e-books, or contracts ‚Äî is tedious and time-consuming. Often, files are saved with generic names such as `document.pdf`, `file(3).pdf`, or `scan_2024_05_01.pdf`. This tool solves that problem by reading the document and renaming it to something meaningful based on its contents.

### üí° Use Cases

- **Researchers & Academics**: Automatically rename papers downloaded from journals to include the title and authors.
- **Students**: Keep your coursework, notes, and study materials neatly labeled and searchable.
- **Professionals**: Organize invoices, contracts, and reports without having to open and scan each document manually.
- **Anyone with a messy Downloads folder**: Bring order to chaos by turning vague file names into descriptive ones.

## Features

- Automatically processes all PDF files containing for example "infographic" in their filename
- Performs OCR on PDFs using `ocrmypdf`
- Extracts text content from PDFs
- Generates concise, descriptive filenames using Ollama's AI
- Interactive renaming with options for single or batch processing
- Available in both shell script and Go implementations
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)

## Requirements

- `ocrmypdf`: Required for PDF text extraction (mandatory dependency)
- `curl`: For making API requests
- `jq`: For JSON processing
- `Ollama`: Running locally with one of the following models:
  - `gemma3:1b` (default): Lightweight model, good for general purpose renaming
  - `llama3.3:latest`: More powerful model, recommended for subject-specific content

### Model Selection

The tool supports different Ollama models, each with its own strengths and hardware requirements:

- **gemma3:1b** (default)
  - Lightweight and fast
  - Good for general purpose renaming
  - Suitable for most use cases
  - Hardware requirements:
    - Minimal resource usage
    - Works well on most modern systems, including laptops
    - Suitable for systems with limited resources

- **llama3.3:latest**
  - More powerful and context-aware
  - Better for subject-specific content
  - Recommended for academic papers, technical documents
  - Hardware requirements:
    - Requires significant system resources
    - Needs a powerful system with ample memory
    - May not be suitable for all environments

- **qwen2.5vl:7b** (for fast mode)
  - Vision-language model capable of understanding images
  - Used in fast mode for image-based processing
  - Faster processing by avoiding OCR
  - Hardware requirements:
    - Requires significant system resources
    - Needs a powerful system with ample memory
    - GPU acceleration recommended

Note: Resource usage varies depending on your system configuration, model quantization, and workload. If you're unsure about your system's capabilities, start with the default gemma3:1b model.

To use a different model, specify it with the `-m` or `--model` option:
```bash
# Use the default model (gemma3:1b)
./process_pdfs.sh document.pdf

# Use llama3.3 for better subject understanding
./process_pdfs.sh -m llama3.3:latest document.pdf

# Use fast mode with qwen2.5vl:7b for image-based processing
./process_pdfs.sh -fast document.pdf
```

### Fast Mode

The tool now supports a fast mode that uses image-based processing instead of OCR. This mode:
- Converts PDFs to images using vips
- Uses the qwen2.5vl:7b model to analyze images directly
- Avoids the time-consuming OCR process
- May provide better results for documents with complex layouts or images

To use fast mode:
```bash
# Enable fast mode
./process_pdfs.sh -fast document.pdf

# Fast mode with custom prompt
./process_pdfs.sh -fast -p "Create a filename based on this image content" document.pdf
```

Note: Fast mode requires the qwen2.5vl:7b model to be installed. The tool will automatically switch to this model when fast mode is enabled.

## Installation

### Shell Script Version (Recommended for Most Users)

The shell script version is the simplest way to get started and provides all the functionality you need. It's easy to use and doesn't require any compilation.

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ocrmypdf curl jq
   brew install ollama
   ```

2. Download and set up the gemma3:1b model (or your preferred model):
   ```bash
   # Start Ollama service
   ollama serve

   # In a new terminal, pull the default model
   ollama pull gemma3:1b
   ```

   Note: You can use any Ollama model by specifying it with the `-m` or `--model` option.

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x process_pdfs.sh
   ```

### Go Version (For Advanced Users)

The Go implementation provides the same functionality as the shell script but is compiled into a binary. This version is recommended if you:
- Need to distribute the tool to users who shouldn't need to install dependencies
- Want to integrate the tool into other systems
- Prefer working with compiled binaries

To build the Go version:

1. Install Go (version 1.21 or later)
2. Choose your build method:

   #### Standard Build
   ```bash
   go build -o ai-pdf-renamer main.go
   ```
   This creates a binary for your current platform.

   #### Cross-Platform Build with Dagger
   ```bash
   cd dagger
   go run main.go
   ```
   This creates binaries for multiple platforms (see Build Options section below).

## Usage

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note

Before using the tool with automatic renaming (`-a` option), it's crucial to:
1. Test the tool with a few sample files first
2. Verify that the generated filenames are appropriate
3. Review the content extraction and AI suggestions
4. Only use automatic renaming (`-a`) once you're confident in the results

### Shell Script Usage

```bash
./process_pdfs.sh [OPTIONS] [FILE_PATTERNS...]
```

#### Options
- `-h, --help`: Show help message
- `-a, --auto`: Automatically rename all files without confirmation (use with caution!)
- `-p, --prompt`: Use a custom prompt for filename generation
- `-m, --model`: Specify the Ollama model to use (default: gemma3:1b)

#### Examples

1. Test the tool with a single file first:
   ```bash
   ./process_pdfs.sh document.pdf
   ```

2. Process all PDF files in current directory (with confirmation):
   ```bash
   ./process_pdfs.sh '*.pdf'
   ```

3. Process specific files:
   ```bash
   ./process_pdfs.sh file1.pdf file2.pdf
   ```

4. Process files with custom prompt:
   ```bash
   ./process_pdfs.sh -p "Create a filename that emphasizes the main topic and date from this text: $text" '*.pdf'
   ```

5. Process files with a different model:
   ```bash
   ./process_pdfs.sh -m llama3.3:latest '*.pdf'
   ```

6. Process files automatically (only after testing!):
   ```bash
   ./process_pdfs.sh -a '*.pdf'
   ```

7. Process files from a list:
   ```bash
   cat filelist.txt | xargs ./process_pdfs.sh
   ```

### Go Binary Usage

If you're using the Go implementation, replace `./process_pdfs.sh` with `./ai-pdf-renamer` in all the examples above. The functionality and options are identical, including the model selection option (`-m` or `--model`).

## How it Works

1. The tool processes each PDF file using OCR to extract text content
2. The extracted text is sent to Ollama's AI model (gemma3:1b) to generate a meaningful filename
3. For each file, you can:
   - Accept the suggested filename
   - Keep the original name
   - Automatically rename all remaining files
   - Use a custom prompt for filename generation

## Default Prompt

The default prompt used for filename generation is:
```
Extract the most important keywords from this text and create a filename. The filename should be concise (max 64 chars), use only the most important keywords, and separate words with dashes. Do not include any explanations or additional text.
```

You can override this using the `-p/--prompt` option.

## Build Options

The Go implementation can be built in two ways:

1. **Standard Go Build**
   ```bash
   go build -o ai-pdf-renamer main.go
   ```
   This creates a binary for your current platform.

2. **Cross-Platform Build with Dagger**
   ```bash
   cd dagger
   go run main.go
   ```
   This creates binaries for multiple platforms:
   - Linux (amd64, arm64)
   - macOS (amd64, arm64)
   - Windows (amd64)

   The binaries will be placed in the `build` directory with platform-specific names.

   ### Advantages of Dagger Build
   - **Cross-Platform Support**: Builds binaries for all major platforms in a single run
   - **Minimal Requirements**: Only requires a running Docker host - no need to install Go or any other build tools (at least if you have ./dagger/main.go built as an executable)
   - **CI/CD Ready**: Can be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated builds
   - **Reproducible**: Builds are consistent across different environments thanks to containerization
   - **Isolated**: Build process runs in containers, ensuring no conflicts with local development environment

## Notes

- The tool requires Ollama to be running locally on port 11434
- Generated filenames are limited to 64 characters
- Only alphanumeric characters and dashes are allowed in generated filenames
- The tool will skip non-PDF files and non-existent files

## Testing

The project includes tests for the Go implementation:

### Go Tests
The Go implementation includes unit tests for:
- Configuration handling
- Default values
- Flag parsing
- Dagger build process
- Build platform support
- Output path handling

Run the tests with:
```bash
go test -v
```

### Shell Script Testing (TODO)
Testing for the shell script version is planned but not yet implemented. The following areas will be covered:
- Dependency checks (ocrmypdf, curl, jq, ollama)
- Command line argument parsing
- Model availability checks
- PDF processing and renaming
- Error handling

Until automated tests are implemented, manual testing is recommended:
1. Start with a small set of test PDFs
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Test with different models
4. Test error cases (missing dependencies, invalid options)
5. Test both interactive and automatic modes
